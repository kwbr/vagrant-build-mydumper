Use vagrant + puppet + fpm to build debs for mydumper.

Based on work and idea from
https://github.com/roidelapluie/vagrant-build-mapnik

You can watch the compilation and build process if you are fast enough with

$ vagrant ssh
$ sudo screen -r

The final packages will be located in the debs/ folder
